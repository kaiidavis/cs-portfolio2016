I have been to many different places in my life. This includes places like Japan in the Ibaraki Prefecture where my mother is born. I also went to a place called Tsukuba
                which is a large city close to my mother's house. Another place that I have been to is Mt. Fuji where I went up most of the mountain and explored what it looked like. I was born in America with Japanese heritage. I grew up learning both
                English and Japanese and can speak both of them fluently. </div>

I like to go camping because my father is in a dive club and we go camping around once a month at a place around the ocean. I have been in the dive club since I was born and have continued
                to enjoy going. While I am camping with the dive club, we go diving and we also eat what we get from the ocean afterwards. I got into diving a couple years ago because I would always go camping with this dive club and I had a good time.
                Because I was having a good time, I started going into the ocean and I have not stopped since. </div>
